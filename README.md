## Example AI Agent Queries

### Query 1: Basic Deposit Lookup
**Agent asks:** *"What's the security deposit limit in New York?"*

**Tool call:**
```json
{ "name": "get_deposit_rules", "arguments": { "state": "NY" } }
```

**Response:**
- Max deposit: **1 month's rent** (HSTPA 2019)
- Return deadline: **14 days**
- Interest required: **No** (except NYC buildings with 6+ units)
- Statute: NY GOL § 7-108

### Query 2: City-Specific Override
**Agent asks:** *"Do Los Angeles landlords have to pay interest on security deposits?"*

**Tool call:**
```json
{ "name": "get_deposit_rules", "arguments": { "state": "CA", "city": "Los Angeles" } }
```

**Response:**
- City override: **Los Angeles**
- Interest required: **No** (state and local law)
- RSO registration required for rent-stabilized units
- Relocation assistance required for no-fault evictions: **$8,141–$21,042**

### Query 3: Multi-State Comparison
**Agent asks:** *"Compare eviction notice periods across all states you cover."*

**Tool call:**
```json
{ "name": "get_eviction_timeline", "arguments": { "compare_states": true } }
```

**Response:**
- **CA:** 3 days (pay or quit), just cause required
- **TX:** 3 days (notice to vacate), no just cause
- **NY:** 14 days (rent demand), good cause required (2024)
- **FL:** 3 days (pay or vacate), no just cause
- **IL:** 5 days (pay or quit), no just cause (except Chicago)

### Query 4: Complex Multi-Step Analysis
**Agent asks:** *"I'm a landlord in Chicago with a tenant who hasn't paid rent. Walk me through the eviction process."*

**Tool calls:**
1. `get_eviction_timeline` → 5-day notice required, just cause under RLTO
2. `get_late_fee_rules` → 5-day grace period before late fees
3. `get_deposit_rules` → Cannot use deposit for last month's rent without consent

**Agent synthesizes:** Chicago RLTO requires 5-day notice, must specify just cause (nonpayment), and estimate 45-90 day court timeline.

## Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Pre-built In-Memory Cache**
   - All 36 legal rules loaded at startup
   - Zero external API calls during queries
   - Atomic cache rebuilds (no race conditions)

2. **Sub-10ms Response Times**
   - Map-based lookups keyed by `{topic}:{state}`
   - O(1) access for state-level rules
   - O(n) filter for city overrides (n < 5 per state)

3. **Type-Safe Architecture**
   - Zod schemas for input validation
   - TypeScript strict mode enabled
   - Structured output schemas (CTX Protocol requirement)

### Data Flow

```
Client Request
    ↓
POST /mcp (StreamableHTTPServerTransport)
    ↓
MCP Server → Tool Handler
    ↓
legalCache.get(topic, state)
    ↓
Map lookup: "security_deposit:CA"
    ↓
City override check (if applicable)
    ↓
structuredContent + outputSchema validation
    ↓
Response (JSON + MCP envelope)
```

## CTX Protocol Compliance

This server is **fully compliant** with the CTX Protocol Data Broker Standard:

### ✅ outputSchema (Zod)
Every tool has a `z.object()` output schema defining the response structure. Required for CTX marketplace validation.

### ✅ structuredContent
All responses include both:
- `content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(...) }]` — Human-readable
- `structuredContent: { ... }` — Structured data for AI agents

### ✅ _meta Injection
All tools include CTX metadata:
```json
{
  "surface": "both",
  "queryEligible": true,
  "latencyClass": "instant",
  "pricing": { "executeUsd": "0.001" },
  "rateLimit": {
    "maxRequestsPerMinute": 120,
    "maxConcurrency": 10,
    "cooldownMs": 500
  }
}
```

### ✅ Session Management
- `POST /mcp` creates/reuses sessions via `X-Session-Id` header
- `DELETE /mcp` cleans up sessions
- `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` handles multi-step handshake

### ✅ Error Handling
Invalid inputs return structured errors with:
- `error` field with description
- `supported_states` array
- `message` with helpful guidance

**A:** Legal rules are verified quarterly. Major law changes (e.g., AB 12 in California) are updated within 30 days of enactment.

### Q: What if I find an error?
**A:** Please open a GitHub issue with:
- Jurisdiction + topic (e.g., "CA security deposits")
- What's incorrect
- Authoritative source showing the correct rule

### Q: Can I use this commercially?
**A:** Yes, under the MIT license. Attribution appreciated but not required.

### Q: Does this work offline?
**A:** Yes. All data is bundled at build time. No internet connection required after installation.

### Q: Why only 5 states?
**A:** We prioritized the 5 most populous states (representing 40% of US renters). Expansion to all 50 states is on the roadmap.
